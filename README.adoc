= Exercise Enum Calculator

In this exercise you build a calculator that has its operations expressed in an [blue]*enum* called `Operator`. 

This enum uses a field of type https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/IntBinaryOperator.html[IntBinaryOperator] (Functional Interface), that specifies the method `applyAsInt(int a, int b)`. 

You will use that field to evaluate the expression.
The enum values in `Operation`` are `ADD`, `SUBTRACT`,
   `MULTIPLY`, `DIVIDE`, and `POWER` with the usual meaning. +
Each enum value has a symbol of type `String`, e.g.
`"+"` for ADD and `"**"` for the Power operation. See also <<table-operations, operations>>.

Your task is to test driven develop the *Operator-enum*. The main class called `Calculator` is given. It uses the `Operator` to do the actual computation.
It can compute simple space-separated integer expressions like `2 + 3` or `2 ** 10`. The main class is just a sample TextUserInterface (TUI) that doesn't need 
to be tested itself.

The functional requirements are:

* The Operator enum has a constructor that takes 2 parameters:
. a symbol string, e.g "+"
. a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/IntBinaryOperator.html[IntBinaryOperator ^]
  (functional interface) object. +
  This is used to supply the actual computation to the enum value
  like in `ADD( "+", ( a, b ) -> a + b )` where the lambda `( a, b ) -> a + b` is the `IntBinaryOperator`. +
  Both constructor parameters are saved as fields.
* You should be able to lookup the Operator by its symbol, using a static method `Operator get(String symbol)`.
* You should be able to lookup the supported Operator symbols, using a static method `String[] supportedSymbols()`
* The Operator has a compute method `int compute(int a, int b)`, which does the actual work and uses the method applyAsInt.
* A division by zero is not allowed and should result in an IllegalArgumentException.

.All operations
[cols="<,^q",options="header"]
|====
| Operator | Symbol
| ADD | '+'
| SUBTRACT | '-'
| MULTIPLY | '*'
| DIVIDE | '/'
| POWER | '**'

The non-functional requirements regarding the tests are that you use a JUnit 5 `@ParameterizedTest`.

   @CsvSource( {
        // the compiler will turn the lines in one string each.
        // eg the first line results in the String "add,+,6, 2, 3 "
        // we use this technique to let the compiler
        // do the _hard_ work of computing the result values.
        // message, sym, expected, a,b
        "add,       +," + ( 2 + 3 ) + ", 2, 3 "
   } )
    public void testOperator( String message, String symbol,
                             int expected, int a, int b  ) {
      // test code left out, the exercise ;-))
